Hello, all! Beginning this Friday (in two days)[^earlier], I'm going
to start an experiment that I call **Rust office hours**. The idea is
simple: I've set aside a few slots per week to help people work
through problems they are having learning or using Rust. My goal here
is both to be of service but also to gain more insight into the kinds
of things people have trouble with. **No problem is too big or too
small!**[^big]

[^big]: OK, some problems may be too big. I'm not *that* clever, and it's only a 30 minute slot.

To start, I'm running this through my [`office-hours` GitHub
repository][oh].  All you have to do to sign up for a slot is to open
a pull request adding your name; I will try to resolve things on a
first come, first serve basis.

[oh]: https://github.com/nikomatsakis/office-hours

I'm starting small: I've reserved two 30 minute slots per week for the
rest of September. One of those slots is reserved for beginner folks,
the other is for anybody. If this is a success, I'll extend to October
and beyond, and possibly add more slots.

So please, come check out [the `office-hours` repository][oh]!

[^earlier]: Uh, I meant to post this blog post earlier. But I forgot.
