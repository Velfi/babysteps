Last Thursday and Friday I had the good fortune of presenting a paper
of mine at [HotPar 2012][hp].  The paper is called
[Parallel Closures: A New Twist on an Old Idea][epc]; it basically
describes what has evolved to become the PJs (Parallel JavaScript)
model, though it does so in the context of a static checker built in
Java.

I really enjoyed the workshop: the presenters were generally very good
and the audience was lively.  I also appreciate that they make an
effort to encourage good conversation; for example, at lunchtime the
tables are labeled with topics for discussion ("memory models", say,
or, "schedulers"). It's always hard for young folk like myself to get
connected with the older, more knowledgable people in the audience, so
everything helps.  ("Hi Hans Boehm, love your work on C++ memory
models")

I had originally though to take notes on the individual presentations
and then write up little summaries.  But it turns out that HotPar
takes minutes and---truth be told---such blog posts are always a bit
dull.  So I thought I'd just focus on a theme that was raised
throughout that I find very interesting.

The theme is the interplay between data layout and performant
parallelism.  I'll first describe some of the papers and presentations
that touched on it, then share some thoughts.

### Specializing for NUMA architectures

For example, an ex-colleague of mine, Zoltan Majo, presented a paper
on [specializing memory layout for NUMA architectures][zm], in which
he described his efforts to improve the performance of an image
classification algorithm which groups similar images together.  The
high-level summary of the algorithm is that it extracts "features"
from the images and creates a hashtable mapping from each feature to
images that have that feature.  Finally, for each image, it iterates
over each such feature, extracts the other images with that feature,
and compares them against the reference image.

This is a very memory intensive benchmark.  The way it was coded up
resulted in very poor performance in NUMA architectures (NUMA stands
for "non-uniform memory access"; a NUMA architecture is one in which
the memory banks are divided so that the time to access them will vary
depending on the CPU where the memory access occurs).  The reason for
this is that the images are effectively randomly scattered between the
two CPUs.  Then each CPU iterates over half of the reference images;
processing any given reference image will involve memory stored at all
of the memory banks.  Hence we are effectively guaranteed to have a
large portion of "remote" accesses (access to memory that is not local
to the particular CPU).  Zoltan's solution is simple but very clever:
instead of having the value in the hashtable be a set of images, he
has the value be a list of sets of images, divided up based on the CPU
where the image is located.  Instead of processing all of the images
under a given hash on the same CPU, he then sends a closure over to
each CPU to just process the images that are local to that CPU.  So
basically the processing for a single reference image ends up getting
spread into several closures operating over all the CPUs, each one
only comparing against the images that are local to the given CPU.

### Virtualizing the layout and storage mechanisms

In a panel discussion, Andrew Brownsword described the problems that
he encounters in his day job of building video games and
high-performance computing (HPC) systems.  He stated that the single
most important factor in getting good performance is *data
organization and access patterns*.  And yet this is completely ignored
by most programming models.  I think this is very true; it's been
bothering me for some time.  More thoughts on that later.

One thing he described that he would particularly like to have would
be the ability to define logical data structures but easily change how
they are represented in memory; for example, converting from an array
of structs to a parallel arrays for each data field and so forth.  I
was a bit dissapointed in that I was not able to get more concrete
examples of what he meant by this, even when I approached him after
the panel.  However, perhaps I will pursue him over e-mail.  I think
this could be highly relevant to Rust and Servo. (Databases, of
course, have this ability, so maybe we should look there for ideas on
how to proceed).

### Leo Meyerovich's work on webpage layout

This was not presented on HotPar, but it's been on my mind for some
time.  Leo does brilliant work on parallelizing web-page layout.  One
of the takeaway lessons from his work is the importance of data
structure layout.  He spends a lot of time optimizing the layout for
SIMD and cache access patterns and shows tremendous performance
benefits from doing so.  The reason that this bothers me so much is
that it is rather unclear to me how much this can be done in the face
of dynamic changes to the web page layout, not to mention how well
such changes can be encapsulated.  This touches on the themes of the
prior talk: it is a shame if we are not able to separate out the final
layout of the data structures from the code which touches them.  And
yet for high performance it is generally necessary to specialize code
to the data structures and tasks at hand.

Leo's solution is to use a high-level language based on attribute
grammars and to synthesize the code.  This is a very nice solution but
it is unclear whether it is sufficiently general.  Still I think any
attempt to virtualize the accessor code will ultimately be somewhat
generated.

### My own paper

I think that my own paper is a good anti-example of this trend.  That
is, one of the outright *goals* in my work was to support current
programming encapsulation practices in the face of parallelism.  I was
trying to make it possible to use closures to safely build parallel
control-flow; one of the features of a closure is that it encapsulates
the precise data that it accesses.  In a parallel world, though, it's
asking for trouble to allow closures to run off and access any data at
all: this is how data races are born.  So my proposal is to
distinguish *parallel closures*, in which the encapsulated environment
is read-only, from *traditional, sequential closures*, which have full
access to the encapsulated environment.

I think this is an incredibly powerful idea, if I do so say so myself.
It offers comparable or stronger correctness guarantees than typical
effect systems (e.g., the
[Disciplined Concurrent Programming Using Tasks with Effects][dp]
model which was also present at HotPar) without the need for any
effect annotation.  The basic concept is simple and can be explained
in about 5 minutes to virtually anyone, even in a noisy bar
(experimentally verified numerous times at JSConf).  Try to explain
the concept of a parameterized effect system to someone who doesn't
even understand type systems.  This is not a knock on effect systems;
I love effect systems.  But I think that the expressivity to
complexity ratio is far higher for parallel closures.

All that said, the idea of encapsulating the set of data that a
parallel closure will acceses seems to be fairly opposed to the idea
of tightly integrating the data-to-be-accessed with the task model
itself.  I can imagine that an effect system has a certain advantage
here: the effects are visible.

A system like
[Disciplined Concurrent Programming Using Tasks with Effects][dp], in
particular, will require the ability to *reify* the effects, thus
making them accessible to the scheduler.  It seems like it would be
fairly straightforward to extend the scheduler on that model to be
NUMA-aware: it could examine the set of objects to be written and try
to pick the best core to execute each task.  However, there will be
some practical challenges: the effects of a task only mention the data
to be accessed, but not how many times it will be accessed.
Furthermore, the size of each region is not specified, nor is the
amount of data from a given region that will actually be touched.

### Synthesis

So what does a more *data-aware* parallel model look like?  I am not
100% sure, but I am starting to have some thoughts on the matter.
This is going to be part pattern and part language design.  It seems
like the data structure which will need to be accessed in parallel
needs to be encapsulated into an object.  So, we might have a
`ParallelTable` class or some such.  This class will not expose its
layout directly but will rather provide accessors for manipulating its
contents; this ensures that the internal layout of the class can be
changed at any time (perhaps even dynamically).

In fact, it seems best that the class does not even offer methods for
directly accessing its fields.  Rather, it offers the ability to spawn
a task which will be given access to the fields of the class.  This is
more-or-less pursuant to Zoltan's NUMA system.  Processing an image in 
JavaScript would then involve an API something like:

    img.process(function(view) {
        // closure that can work with the image, using the
        // `view` object
    });
    
The image API would automatically invoke this closure over on the node
where the image is stored.  Of course, if you have to process two
images, one will always be remote access.  So for that you would end
up writing code like:

    img1.process(function(view1) {
        img2.process(function(view2) {
            // view1 is remote
        }
    });
    
APIs like [RiverTrail][rt] also fit well into this paradigm.  You have an
array type but the user is encouraged to write transformations of this
array as kernel functions applied over the array as a whole.
