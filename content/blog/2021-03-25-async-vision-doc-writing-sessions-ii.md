I'm scheduling two more public drafting sessions for tomorrow, Match 26th:

* On March 26th at 10am ET ([click to see in your local timezone][noon]), we will be working on writing a story about the challenges of writing a library that can be reused across many runtimes ([rust-lang/wg-async-foundations#45](https://github.com/rust-lang/wg-async-foundations/issues/45));
* On March 26th at 2pm ET ([click to see in your local tomezone][2pm]), we will be working on writing a story about the difficulty of debugging and interpreting async stack traces ([rust-lang/wg-async-foundations#69](https://github.com/rust-lang/wg-async-foundations/issues/69)).

If you're available and have interest in one of those issues, please join us!
Just ping me on Discord or Zulip and I'll send you the Zoom link.

I also plan to schedule more sessions next week, so stay tuned!

### The vision...what?

Never heard of the async vision doc? It's a new thing we're trying as part of the Async Foundations Working Group:

> We are launching a collaborative effort to build a shared [vision document][vd] for Async Rust. **Our goal is to engage the entire community in a collective act of the imagination:** how can we make the end-to-end experience of using Async I/O not only a pragmatic choice, but a _joyful_ one?
