On internals, I [just announced][i] the formation of the
language-design team meta working group. The role of the meta working
group is to figure out how other language-design team working groups
should work. The plan is to begin by enumerating some of our goals --
the problems we aim to solve, the good things we aim to keep -- and
then move on to draw up more details plans. I expect this discussion
will intersect the RFC process quite heavily (at least when it comes
to language design changes). Should be interesting! It's all happening
in the open, and a major goal of mine is for this to be easy to follow
along with from the outside -- so if talking about talking is your
thing, you should [check it out][i].
