For the past year or so, I and a few others have been iterating on
some tutorial slides for learning Rust. I've given this tutorial here
at the local [Boston Rust Meetup] a few times, and we used the same
basic approach at RustConf; I've been pretty happy with the
results. But until now it's been limited to "in person" events.

That's why I'm so happy to announce a new site, [Into Rust]. Into Rust
contains screencasts of many of these slides, and in particular the
ones I consider most important: those that cover Ownership and
Borrowing, which I think is the best place to start teaching Rust.
I've divided up the material into roughly 30min screencasts so that
they should be relatively easy to consume in one sitting -- each also
has some associated exercises to help make your knowledge more
concrete.

I want to give special thanks to [Liz Baillie], who did all the
awesome artwork on the site.
