<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/850/1*T__f3-PmPA5TDDoPW_uX3A.png" width="222" style="float:left;"/> Wow! The response to the last Rustc Reading Club was overwhelming -- literally! We maxed out the number of potential zoom attendees and I couldn't even join the call! It's clear that there's a lot of demand here, which is great. We've decided to take another stab at running the Rustc Reading Club, but we're going to try it a bit differently this time. We're going to start by selecting a smaller group to do it a few times and see how it goes, and then decide how to scale up.

## The ask

## Start small...

As Doc Jones announced in [her post], we're going to hold our second meeting on December 2, 2021 at 12PM EST ([see in your timezone](https://everytimezone.com/s/d2a61447)). Read [her post] for all the details on how that's going to work! To avoid a repeat of last time, **this meeting will be invite only** -- we're going to "hand select" about 10-15 people from the folks who sign up, looking for a range of experience and interests. The reason for this is that we want to try out the idea with a smaller group and see how it goes.

## ...and scale!

Presuming the club is a success, we would love to have more active clubs going on. My expectation is that we will have a number of rustc reading clubs of different kinds and flavors -- for example, a recorded club, or a club that is held on Zulip instead of Zoom, or clubs in other languages.[^doyourown] As we try out new ideas, we'll make sure to reach out to people who [signed up on the google form][form], so please do sign up if you are interested!

[^doyourown]: In fact, if you're *really* excited, you don't need to wait for us -- just create a zoom room and invite your friends to read some code! Or leave a message in [#rustc-reading-club on zulip](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/305296-rustc-reading-club), I bet you'd find some takers.
