You may have heard that [the Rust 2021 Edition is coming](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2021/05/11/edition-2021.html). Along with my daughter Daphne, I have recorded a little song in honor of the occasion! The full lyrics are below -- if you feel inspired, please make your own version![^omg] Enjoy!

[^omg]: OMG, that would be amazing. I'll update the post with any such links I find.

### Lyrics

(Spoken)<br/>
Breaking changes where no code breaks.<br/>
Sounds impossible, no?<br/>
But in the Rust language, you might say that we like to do impossible things.<br/>
It isn't easy.<br/>
You may ask, how do we manage such a thing?<br/>
That I can tell you in one word... Edition!<br/>

(Chorus)<br/>
Edition, edition... edition!

(Lang)<br/>
Who day and night<br/>
Is searching for a change<br/>
Whatever they can do<br/>
So Rust's easier for you<br/>
Who sometimes finds<br/>
They have to tweak the rules<br/>
And change a thing or two in Rust?

(All)<br/>
The lang team, the lang team... edition!<br/>
The lang team, the lang team... edition!

(Libs)<br/>
Who designs the traits that we use each day?<br/>
All the time, in every way?<br/>
Who updates the prelude so that we can call<br/>
The methods that we want no sweat

(All)<br/>
The libs team, the libs team... edition!<br/>
The libs team, the libs team... edition!

(Users)<br/>
Three years ago I changed my code<br/>
to Rust twenty eighteen<br/>
Some dependencies did not<br/>
But they... kept working.
 
(All)<br/>
The users, the users... edition!<br/>
The users, the users... edition!

(Tooling)<br/>
And who does all this work<br/>
To patch and tweak and fix<br/>
Migrating all our code<br/>
Each edition to the next

(All)<br/>
The tooling, the tooling... edition!<br/>
The tooling, the tooling... edition!

(Spoken)<br/>
And here in Rust, we've always had our little slogans.<br/>
For instance, abstraction... without overhead.<br/>
Concurrency... without data races.<br/>
Stability... without stagnation.<br/>
Hack... without fear.<br/>
But we couldn't do all of those things...<br/>
not without...<br/>
Edition!
