This blog is I post up various half-baked ideas that I have. I work on the [Rust programming language](http://rust-lang.org/), so often &ndash; *but not always* &ndash; these ideas have to do with some aspect of Rust. I called the blog Baby Steps mostly because I couldn’t up with good name, but also because I feel like research is a process of taking tiny, incremental steps towards something better. If you’d like to contact me, you can reach me at niko@alum.mit.edu.
